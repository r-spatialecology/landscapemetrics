# landscapemetrics 2.1.0
* Improvements
    * Many performance improvements. Most visible are in
    `calculate_lsm` (all metrics: more than 5 times faster with 70% less memory 
    allocation for `augusta_nlcd`; larger increases were found for smaller data)
    and `window_lsm` (a single metric: more than 6 times faster for `augusta_nlcd`; 
    larger increases were found for smaller data)
    * Some performance improvements are related to the new "extras" mechanism, in which several objects 
    are precalculated in `calculate_lsm`
    * Creates an internal `extras_df` object that lists which extras are needed by
    each metric
    * Replaces the use of `tibble::tibble()` with `tibble::new_tibble(list())` in most functions.
    This change is partially responsible for improvements of the `window_lsm` speed
    * Replaces `raster_to_points` with `get_points` in several places. 
    The `get_points` function is based on the column and row numbers multiplied by
    the resolution, not actual coordinates.
    * Replaces `table` with (faster) `tabulate` in `lsm_p_core`
* New functions
    * Adds a few internal helper functions and documents them, including `prepare_extras`,
    `get_area_patches`, `get_class_patches`, `get_complexity`, `get_enn_patch`, 
    `get_points`, and `get_perimeter_patch`
* Bugfixes
    * Fixes `window_lsm` behaviour for situations with NAs values and non-square windows
* Various
    * Fixes several typos and improves documentation in many places
    * Uses object references in most rcpp functions
