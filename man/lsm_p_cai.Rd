\title{CAI (patch level)}
\usage{
lsm_p_cai(landscape, directions = 8, consider_boundary = FALSE, edge_depth = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{landscape}{A categorical raster object: SpatRaster; Raster* Layer, Stack, Brick; stars or a list of SpatRasters.}

\item{directions}{The number of directions in which patches should be
connected: 4 (rook's case) or 8 (queen's case).}

\item{consider_boundary}{Logical if cells that only neighbour the landscape
boundary should be considered as core}

\item{edge_depth}{Distance (in cells) a cell has the be away from the patch
edge to be considered as core cell}
}
\value{

\description{
Core area index (Core area metric)
}
\details{
\deqn{CAI = (\frac{a_{ij}^{core}} {a_{ij}}) * 100}
where \eqn{a_{ij}^{core}} is the core area in square meters and \eqn{a_{ij}}
is the area in square meters.

CAI is a 'Core area metric'. It equals the percentage of a patch that is core area.
A cell is defined as core area if the cell has no neighbour with a different value
than itself (rook's case). It describes patch area and shape simultaneously (more core area
when the patch is large and the shape is rather compact, i.e. a square). Because the index is
relative, it is comparable among patches with different area.

Because the metric is based on distances or areas please make sure your data
is valid using \code{\link{check_landscape}}.

\subsection{Units}{Percent}
\subsection{Range}{0 <= CAI <= 100}
\subsection{Behaviour}{CAI = 0 when the patch has no core area and
approaches CAI = 100 with increasing percentage of core area within a patch.}
