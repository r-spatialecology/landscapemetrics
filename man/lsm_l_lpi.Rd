\title{LPI (landscape level)}
\usage{
lsm_l_lpi(landscape, directions = 8)
}
\arguments{
\item{landscape}{Raster* Layer, Stack, Brick, SpatRaster (terra), stars, or a list of rasterLayers.}

\item{directions}{The number of directions in which patches should be
connected: 4 (rook's case) or 8 (queen's case).}
}
\value{
tibble
}
\description{
Largest patch index (Area and Edge metric)
}
\details{
\deqn{LPI = \frac{\max (a_{ij})} {A} * 100}
where \eqn{max(a_{ij})} is the area of the patch in square meters and \eqn{A}
is the total landscape area in square meters.

The largest patch index is an 'Area and edge metric'. It is the percentage of the
landscape covered by the largest patch in the landscape. It is a simple
measure of dominance.

\subsection{Units}{Percentage}
\subsection{Range}{0 < LPI <= 100}
\subsection{Behaviour}{Approaches LPI = 0 when the largest patch is becoming small
and equals LPI = 100 when only one patch is present}
