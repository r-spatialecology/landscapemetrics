\arguments{
\item{landscape}{A categorical raster object: SpatRaster; Raster* Layer, Stack, Brick; stars or a list of SpatRasters.}

\item{level}{Level of metrics. Either 'patch', 'class' or 'landscape' (or vector with combination).}

\item{metric}{Abbreviation of metrics (e.g. 'area').}

\item{name}{Full name of metrics (e.g. 'core area').}

\item{type}{Type according to FRAGSTATS grouping (e.g. 'aggregation metrics').}

\item{what}{Selected level of metrics: either "patch", "class" or "landscape".
It is also possible to specify functions as a vector of strings, e.g. \code{what = c("lsm_c_ca", "lsm_l_ta")}.}

\item{directions}{The number of directions in which patches should be
connected: 4 (rook's case) or 8 (queen's case).}

\item{count_boundary}{Include landscape boundary in edge length.}

\item{consider_boundary}{Logical if cells that only neighbour the landscape
boundary should be considered as core.}

\item{edge_depth}{Distance (in cells) a cell has to be away from the patch
edge to be considered as core cell.}

\item{cell_center}{If true, the coordinates of the centroid are forced to be
a cell center within the patch.}

\item{classes_max}{Potential maximum number of present classes.}

\item{neighbourhood}{The number of directions in which cell adjacencies are considered as neighbours:
4 (rook's case) or 8 (queen's case). The default is 4.}

\item{ordered}{The type of pairs considered. Either ordered (TRUE) or unordered (FALSE).
The default is TRUE.}

\item{base}{The unit in which entropy is measured. The default is "log2",
which compute entropy in "bits". "log" and "log10" can be also used.}

\item{full_name}{Should the full names of all functions be included in the
tibble.}

\item{verbose}{Print warning messages.}

\item{progress}{Print progress report.}

\description{
Calculate a selected group of metrics
}
\details{
Wrapper to calculate several landscape metrics. The metrics can be specified
by the arguments \code{what}, \code{level}, \code{metric}, \code{name} and/or \code{type} (combinations
of different arguments are possible (e.g. \verb{level = "class", type = "aggregation metric"}).
If an argument is not provided, automatically all possibilities are
selected. Therefore, to get \strong{all} available metrics, don't specify any of the
above arguments.

For all metrics based on distances or areas please make sure your data is valid
using \code{\link{check_landscape}}.

\examples{
\dontrun{
landscape <- terra::rast(landscapemetrics::landscape)
calculate_lsm(landscape, progress = TRUE)
calculate_lsm(landscape, what = c("patch", "lsm_c_te", "lsm_l_pr"))
calculate_lsm(landscape, level = c("class", "landscape"),
type = "aggregation metric")
