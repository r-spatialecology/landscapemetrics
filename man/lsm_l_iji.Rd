\usage{
lsm_l_iji(landscape, verbose = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{landscape}{A categorical raster object: SpatRaster; Raster* Layer, Stack, Brick; stars or a list of SpatRasters.}

\item{verbose}{Print warning message if not sufficient patches are present}
}
\value{
tibble

\description{
Interspersion and Juxtaposition index (Aggregation metric)
}
\details{
\deqn{IJI = \frac{- \sum \limits_{i = 1}^{m} \sum \limits_{k = i + 1}^{m} \Bigg[ \Bigg( \frac{e_{ik}}{E} \Bigg) ln \Bigg( \frac{e_{ik}}{E} \Bigg) \Bigg]}{ln(0.5[m(m - 1)])}  * 100}

where \eqn{e_{ik}} are the unique adjacencies of all classes (lower/upper triangle of
the adjacency table - without the diagonal), \eqn{E} is the total length of edges in the landscape
and \eqn{m} is the number of classes.

IJI is an 'Aggregation metric'. It is a so called "salt and pepper" metric and
describes the intermixing of classes (i.e. without considering like adjacencies - the
diagonal of the adjacency table). The number of classes to calculate IJI must be >= than 3.

\subsection{Units}{Percent}
\subsection{Range}{0 < IJI <= 100}
\subsection{Behaviour}{Approaches 0 if a class is only adjacent to a single other class
and equals 100 when a class is equally adjacent to all other classes.}
