\title{PD (landscape level)}
\usage{
lsm_l_pd(landscape, directions = 8)
}
\arguments{
\item{landscape}{A categorical raster object: SpatRaster; Raster* Layer, Stack, Brick; stars or a list of SpatRasters.}

\item{directions}{The number of directions in which patches should be
connected: 4 (rook's case) or 8 (queen's case).}
}
\value{
tibble
}
\description{
Patch density (Aggregation metric)
}
\details{
\deqn{PD = \frac{N} {A} * 10000 * 100}
where \eqn{N} is the number of patches and \eqn{A} is the total landscape
area in square meters.

PD is an 'Aggregation metric'. It describes the fragmentation the landscape, however,
does not necessarily contain information about the configuration or composition of the
landscape. In contrast to \code{\link{lsm_l_np}} it is standardized to the area and
comparisons among landscapes with different total area are possible.

Because the metric is based on distances or areas please make sure your data
is valid using \code{\link{check_landscape}}.

\subsection{Units}{Number per 100 hectares}
\subsection{Ranges}{0 < PD <= 1e+06}
\subsection{Behaviour}{Increases as the landscape gets more patchy. Reaches its maximum
if every cell is a different patch.}
