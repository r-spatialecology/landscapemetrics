points will be labelled 1...n.}

\description{
Sample metrics
}
\details{
This function samples the selected metrics in a buffer area (sample plot)
around sample points, sample lines or within provided polygons. To see more details
about arguments passed on to the metrics, please see \code{calculate_lsm()}.

The metrics can be specified by the arguments \code{what}, \code{level}, \code{metric}, \code{name}
and/or \code{type} (combinations of different arguments are possible (e.g.
\verb{level = "class", type = "aggregation metric"}). If an argument is not provided,
automatically all possibilities are selected. Therefore, to get \strong{all}
available metrics, don't specify any of the above arguments.

For all metrics based on distances or areas please make sure your data is valid
using \code{\link{check_landscape}}.

Please be aware that the output is slightly different to all other \code{lsm}-function
of \code{landscapemetrics}.

The size of the actual sampled landscape can be different to the provided size
due to two reasons. Firstly, because clipping raster cells using a circle or a
sample plot not directly at a cell center lead to inaccuracies. Secondly, sample
plots can exceed the landscape boundary. Therefore, we report the actual clipped
sample plot area relative in relation to the theoretical, maximum sample plot
area e.g. a sample plot only half within the landscape will have a \code{percentage_inside = 50}.
Additionally, if the polygon representing the sample plot is smaller than the cell
size of the raster, the \code{percentage_inside} may exceed 100\%. To calculate the area of
the buffer zones, the function \code{terra::expanse()} is used. The area results may
be influenced by the CRS and the \code{transform} argument.

Please be aware that the function behaves differently for POLYGONS and MULTIPOLYGONS.
In the first case, each polygon is used as a singular sample area, while in the second
case all polygons are used as one sample area.
