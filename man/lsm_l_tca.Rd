\title{TCA (landscape level)}
\usage{
lsm_l_tca(landscape, directions = 8, consider_boundary = FALSE, edge_depth = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{landscape}{A categorical raster object: SpatRaster; Raster* Layer, Stack, Brick; stars or a list of SpatRasters.}

\item{directions}{The number of directions in which patches should be
connected: 4 (rook's case) or 8 (queen's case).}

\item{consider_boundary}{Logical if cells that only neighbour the landscape
boundary should be considered as core}

\item{edge_depth}{Distance (in cells) a cell has the be away from the patch
edge to be considered as core cell}
}
\value{
tibble
}
\description{
Total core area (Core area metric)
}
\details{
\deqn{TCA = \sum \limits_{j = 1}^{n} a_{ij}^{core} * (\frac{1} {10000})}
where here \eqn{a_{ij}^{core}} is the core area in square meters.

TCA is a 'Core area metric' and equals the sum of core areas of all patches in the
landscape. A cell is defined as core area if the cell has no neighbour with a different
value than itself (rook's case). In other words, the core area of a patch is all area that
is not an edge. It characterises patch areas and shapes of all patches in the landscape
simultaneously (more core area when the patch is large and the shape is rather compact,
i.e. a square). Additionally, TCA is a measure for the configuration of the landscape,
because the sum of edges increase as patches are less aggregated.

Because the metric is based on distances or areas please make sure your data
is valid using \code{\link{check_landscape}}.

\subsection{Units}{Hectares}
\subsection{Range}{TCA >= 0}
\subsection{Behaviour}{Increases, without limit, as patch areas increase
and patch shapes simplify. TCA = 0 when every cell in every patch is an edge.}
