\title{SPLIT (landscape level)}
\usage{
lsm_l_split(landscape, directions = 8)
}
\arguments{
\item{landscape}{A categorical raster object: SpatRaster; Raster* Layer, Stack, Brick; stars or a list of SpatRasters.}

\item{directions}{The number of directions in which patches should be
connected: 4 (rook's case) or 8 (queen's case).}
}
\value{
tibble

\description{
Splitting index (Aggregation metric)
}
\details{
\deqn{SSPLIT = \frac{A^2} {\sum \limits_{i = 1}^{m} \sum \limits_{j = 1}^{n} a_{ij}^2}}
where \eqn{a_{ij}} is the patch area in square meters and \eqn{A} is the
total landscape area.

SPLIT is an 'Aggregation metric'. It describes the number of patches if all patches the
landscape would be divided into equally sized patches.  Because the metric is based on
distances or areas please make sure your data is valid using \code{\link{check_landscape}}.

\subsection{Units}{None}
\subsection{Range}{1 <= SPLIT <= Number of cells squared}
\subsection{Behaviour}{Equals SPLIT = 1 if only one patch is present. Increases as
the number of patches increases and is limited if all cells are a patch}
