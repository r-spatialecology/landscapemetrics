\title{PARA_CV (landscape level)}
\usage{
lsm_l_para_cv(landscape, directions = 8)
}
\arguments{
\item{landscape}{A categorical raster object: SpatRaster; Raster* Layer, Stack, Brick; stars or a list of SpatRasters.}

\item{directions}{The number of directions in which patches should be
connected: 4 (rook's case) or 8 (queen's case).}
}
\value{
tibble
}
\description{
Coefficient of variation perimeter-area ratio (Shape metric)
}
\details{
\deqn{PARA_{CV} = cv(PARA[patch_{ij}]}
where \eqn{PARA[patch_{ij}]} is the perimeter area ratio of each patch.

PARA_CV is a 'Shape metric'. It summarises the landscape as the Coefficient of variation of
each patch belonging in the landscape The perimeter-area ratio describes the patch complexity
in a straightforward way. However, because it is not standarised to a certain shape
(e.g. a square), it is not scale independent, meaning that increasing the patch size
while not changing the patch form will change the ratio. Because the metric is based on
distances or areas please make sure your data is valid using \code{\link{check_landscape}}.

\subsection{Units}{None}
\subsection{Range}{PARA_CV >= 0}
\subsection{Behaviour}{Equals PARA_CV = 0 if the perimeter-area ratio is identical for
all patches. Increases, without limit, as the variation of the perimeter-area ratio
increases.}
