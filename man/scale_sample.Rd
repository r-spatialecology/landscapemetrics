\description{
Metrics on changing sample scale
}
\details{
This function calculates the selected metrics in sub-sequential buffers around
point(s) of interest. To see more details about arguments passed on to the metrics,
please see \code{calculate_lsm()}.

The metrics can be specified by the arguments \code{what}, \code{level}, \code{metric}, \code{name}
and/or \code{type} (combinations of different arguments are possible (e.g.
\verb{level = "class", type = "aggregation metric"}). If an argument is not provided,
automatically all possibilities are selected. Therefore, to get \strong{all}
available metrics, don't specify any of the above arguments.

For all metrics based on distances or areas please make sure your data is valid
using \code{\link{check_landscape}}.

Please be aware that the output is slightly different to all other \code{lsm}-function
of \code{landscapemetrics}.

The size of the actual sampled landscape can be different to the provided size
due to two reasons. Firstly, because clipping raster cells using a circle or a
sample plot not directly at a cell center lead to inaccuracies. Secondly, sample
plots can exceed the landscape boundary. Therefore, we report the actual clipped
sample plot area relative in relation to the theoretical, maximum sample plot
area e.g. a sample plot only half within the landscape will have a \code{percentage_inside = 50}.
Additionally, if the polygon representing the sample plot is smaller than the cell
size of the raster, the \code{percentage_inside} may exceed 100\%. To calculate the area of
the buffer zones, the function \code{terra::expanse()} is used. The area results may
be influenced by the CRS and the \code{transform} argument.
