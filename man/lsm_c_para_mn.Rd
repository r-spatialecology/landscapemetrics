\description{
Mean perimeter-area ratio (Shape metric)
}
\details{
\deqn{PARA_{MN} = mean(PARA[patch_{ij}]}
where \eqn{PARA[patch_{ij}]} is the perimeter area ratio of each patch.

PARA_MN is a 'Shape metric'. It summarises each class as the mean of
each patch belonging to class i. The perimeter-area ratio describes the patch complexity
in a straightforward way. However, because it is not standarised to a certain shape
(e.g. a square), it is not scale independent, meaning that increasing the patch size
while not changing the patch form will change the ratio.

\subsection{Units}{None}
\subsection{Range}{PARA_MN > 0}
\subsection{Behaviour}{Approaches PARA_MN > 0 if PARA for each patch approaches PARA > 0,
i.e. the form approaches a rather small square. Increases, without limit, as PARA increases,
i.e. patches become more complex.}
