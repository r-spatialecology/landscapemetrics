\usage{
lsm_l_dcore_sd(
  landscape,
  directions = 8,
  consider_boundary = FALSE,
  edge_depth = 1
)
}
\arguments{
\item{landscape}{A categorical raster object: SpatRaster; Raster* Layer, Stack, Brick; stars or a list of SpatRasters.}

\item{directions}{The number of directions in which patches should be
connected: 4 (rook's case) or 8 (queen's case).}

\item{consider_boundary}{Logical if cells that only neighbour the landscape
boundary should be considered as core}

\item{edge_depth}{Distance (in cells) a cell has the be away from the patch
edge to be considered as core cell}
}
\value{
tibble
}
\description{
Standard deviation number of disjunct core areas (Core area metric)
}
\details{
\deqn{DCORE_{SD} = sd(NCORE[patch_{ij}])}
where \eqn{NCORE[patch_{ij}]} is the number of core areas.

DCORE_SD is an 'Core area metric'. It summarises the landscape as the standard deviation
of all patches. A cell is defined as core if the cell has no neighbour with a different
value than itself (rook's case). NCORE counts the disjunct core areas, whereby a core
area is a 'patch within the patch' containing only core cells. The metric describes the
differences among all patches in the landscape.

\subsection{Units}{None}
\subsection{Range}{DCORE_SD >= 0}
\subsection{Behaviour}{Equals DCORE_SD = 0 if all patches have the same number of disjunct
core areas. Increases, without limit, as the variation of number of disjunct core areas
increases.}
