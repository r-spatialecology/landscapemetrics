\arguments{
\item{landscape}{A categorical raster object: SpatRaster; Raster* Layer, Stack, Brick; stars or a list of SpatRasters.}

\item{count_boundary}{Include landscape boundary in edge length}

\item{directions}{The number of directions in which patches should be
connected: 4 (rook's case) or 8 (queen's case).}

\description{
Total (class) edge (Area and Edge metric)
}
\details{
\deqn{TE = \sum \limits_{k = 1}^{m} e_{ik}}
where \eqn{e_{ik}} is the edge lengths in meters.
TE is an 'Area and edge metric'. Total (class) edge includes all edges between class i and
all other classes k. It measures the configuration of the landscape because a highly
fragmented landscape will have many edges. However, total edge is an absolute measure,
making comparisons among landscapes with different total areas difficult. If
\code{count_boundary = TRUE} also edges to the landscape boundary are included.
Because the metric is based on distances or areas please make sure your data
is valid using \code{\link{check_landscape}}.

\subsection{Units}{Meters}
\subsection{Range}{TE >= 0}
\subsection{Behaviour}{Equals TE = 0 if all cells are edge cells. Increases, without limit,
as landscape becomes more fragmented}
