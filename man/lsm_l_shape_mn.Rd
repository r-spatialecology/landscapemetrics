\title{SHAPE_MN (landscape level)}
\usage{
lsm_l_shape_mn(landscape, directions = 8)
}
\arguments{
\item{landscape}{A categorical raster object: SpatRaster; Raster* Layer, Stack, Brick; stars or a list of SpatRasters.}

\item{directions}{The number of directions in which patches should be
connected: 4 (rook's case) or 8 (queen's case).}
}
\value{
tibble
}
\description{
Mean shape index (Shape metric)
}
\details{
\deqn{SHAPE_{MN} = mean(SHAPE[patch_{ij}])}
where \eqn{SHAPE[patch_{ij}]} is the shape index of each patch.

SHAPE_MN is a 'Shape metric'. The landscape is summarised as the mean
of all patches in the landscape. SHAPE describes the ratio between the actual perimeter of
the patch and the square root of patch area.

Because the metric is based on distances or areas please make sure your data
is valid using \code{\link{check_landscape}}.

\subsection{Units}{None}
\subsection{Range}{SHAPE_SD >= 1}
\subsection{Behaviour}{Equals SHAPE_MN = 1 if all patches are squares.
Increases, without limit, as the shapes of patches become more complex.}
