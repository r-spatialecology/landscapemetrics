\usage{
lsm_c_cohesion(landscape, directions = 8)
}
\arguments{
\item{landscape}{A categorical raster object: SpatRaster; Raster* Layer, Stack, Brick; stars or a list of SpatRasters.}

\item{directions}{The number of directions in which patches should be
connected: 4 (rook's case) or 8 (queen's case).}
}
\value{
tibble

\description{
Patch Cohesion Index (Aggregation metric)
}
\details{
\deqn{COHESION = 1 - (\frac{\sum \limits_{j = 1}^{n} p_{ij}} {\sum \limits_{j = 1}^{n} p_{ij} \sqrt{a_{ij}}}) * (1 - \frac{1} {\sqrt{Z}}) ^ {-1} * 100}
where \eqn{p_{ij}} is the perimeter in meters, \eqn{a_{ij}} is the area in square
meters and \eqn{Z} is the number of cells.

COHESION is an 'Aggregation metric'. It characterises the connectedness of patches
belonging to class i. It can be used to asses if patches of the same class are located
aggregated or rather isolated and thereby COHESION gives information about the
configuration of the landscape. Because the metric is based on distances or areas
please make sure your data is valid using \code{\link{check_landscape}}.

\subsection{Units}{Percent}
\subsection{Ranges}{0 < COHESION < 100}
\subsection{Behaviour}{Approaches COHESION = 0 if patches of class i become more isolated.
Increases if patches of class i become more aggregated.}
