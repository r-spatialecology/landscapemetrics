\title{SIDI (landscape level)}
\usage{
lsm_l_sidi(landscape, directions = 8)
}
\arguments{
\item{landscape}{Raster* Layer, Stack, Brick, SpatRaster (terra), stars, or a list of rasterLayers.}

\item{directions}{The number of directions in which patches should be
connected: 4 (rook's case) or 8 (queen's case).}
}

tibble

\description{
Simpson's diversity index (Diversity metric)
}
\details{
\deqn{SIDI = 1 - \sum \limits_{i = 1}^{m} P_{i}^{2}}
where \eqn{P_{i}} is the proportion of class i and \eqn{m} is the
number of classes.

SIDI is a 'Diversity metric'. It is widely used in biodiversity and ecology. It is
less sensitive to rare class types than \code{\link{lsm_l_shdi}}. It can be interpreted
as the probability that two randomly selected cells belong to the same class.

\subsection{Units}{None}
\subsection{Range}{0 <= SIDI < 1}
\subsection{Behaviour}{Equals SIDI = 0 when only one patch is present and approaches
SIDI < 1 when the number of class types increases while the proportions are equally
distributed}
