\title{CORE_MN (landscape level)}
\usage{
lsm_l_core_mn(
  landscape,
  directions = 8,
  consider_boundary = FALSE,
  edge_depth = 1
)
}
\arguments{
\item{landscape}{A categorical raster object: SpatRaster; Raster* Layer, Stack, Brick; stars or a list of SpatRasters.}

\item{directions}{The number of directions in which patches should be
connected: 4 (rook's case) or 8 (queen's case).}

\item{consider_boundary}{Logical if cells that only neighbour the landscape
boundary should be considered as core}

\item{edge_depth}{Distance (in cells) a cell has the be away from the patch
edge to be considered as core cell}
}
\value{
tibble
}
\description{
Mean of core area (Core area metric)
}
\details{
\deqn{CORE_{MN} = mean(CORE[patch_{ij}])}
where \eqn{CORE[patch_{ij}]} is the core area in square meters of each patch.

CORE_MN is a 'Core area metric' and equals the mean of core areas of all patches
in the landscape. The core area is defined as all cells that have no
neighbour with a different value than themselves (rook's case).

Because the metric is based on distances or areas please make sure your data
is valid using \code{\link{check_landscape}}.

\subsection{Units}{Hectares}
\subsection{Range}{CORE_MN >= 0}
\subsection{Behaviour}{Equals CORE_MN = 0 if CORE = 0 for all patches. Increases,
without limit, as the core area indices increase.}
