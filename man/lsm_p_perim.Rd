\usage{
lsm_p_perim(landscape, directions = 8)
}
\arguments{
\item{landscape}{A categorical raster object: SpatRaster; Raster* Layer, Stack, Brick; stars or a list of SpatRasters.}

\item{directions}{The number of directions in which patches should be
connected: 4 (rook's case) or 8 (queen's case).}
}
\value{
tibble

\description{
Perimeter (Area and edge metric)
}
\details{
\deqn{PERIM = p_{ij}}
where \eqn{p_{ij}} is the perimeter in meters.

PERIM is an 'Area and edge metric'. It equals the perimeter of the patch
including also the edge to the landscape boundary. The metric describes
patch area (larger perimeter for larger patches), but also patch shape
(large perimeter for irregular shapes).

Because the metric is based on distances or areas please make sure your data
is valid using \code{\link{check_landscape}}.

\subsection{Units}{Meters}
\subsection{Range}{PERIM > 0}
\subsection{Behaviour}{Increases, without limit, as patch size and
complexity increases.}
